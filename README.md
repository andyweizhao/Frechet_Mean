# Frechet_Mean

Implementation of the Fr√©chet mean (Karcher mean) to be used as a building block in a graph convolutional layer on an spd manifold.

Todos: the forward direction occasionally does not work as it should: sometimes the iteration gets stuck. As of now, the
error is simply ignored when it occurs.
